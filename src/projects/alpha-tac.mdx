## The game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

The game of UTTT (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe) is a recursive version of the more familiar game of Tic Tac Toe (Naughts and Crosses). The game is played on a board consisting of nine mini-boards arranged into the shape of a Tic Tac Toe board. Victory is achieved by winning three mini-boards in a row. The twist is that by playing a move, you restrict your opponents move choices to only play in the mini-board relative to the cell you have just played in. For example if you play in the top right cell of any given mini-board, your opponent must play in the top right mini-board.

## UTTT is really hard

This game presents interesting challenges for both humans and machines to play. The biggest challenge facing players whether your brain is made of silicon or flesh is that it is very difficult to determine which player has an advantage for a given game state. Even some of the worlds best human players struggle to accurately evaluate a game of UTTT played at a high level.

## An approach to building an agent that can play the game

Designing an agent that can play this game involves implementing two key components. Firstly we need to implement a tree searching algorithm that can look into possible future positions of the game. And secondly we need to come up with an evaluation function to guide our search by identifying advantageous positions to play for.

### Recusrive tree search

For the search algorithm we use the minimax algorithm. This algorithm takes a game state and depth as inputs. The algorithm calculates all board states legally reachable in depth=n moves. Then our evaluation function is called on each leaf node game state. The evaluation scores for each leaf node are then propagated up the search tree in a way that selects the most advantageous move for the player who's move it is at each level. Finally an overall evaluation is returned.

### Static evaluation function

Coming up with an evaluation function to guide our search is a critical part of our agent. But as previously mentioned, this is no simple task. For a game like chess we can come up with many useful metrics for evaluating a given game state. How connected are your pawns? How advanced are your pawns? Is your king castled? Are your rooks connected? How active are your minor pieces? Etc. A chess engine will look at all of these metrics and then apply a weighting to each metric. Chess engines can produce some incredibly accurate evaluations this way.

For UTTT it is very difficult to come up with metrics which can be used for a reliable evaluation. For this case one option we have is to make use of Monte-Carlo tree search. This method randomly plays out the game to completion many times and returns the win/loss ratio. While this method is effective, it relies heavily on hardware and is too intensive to produce an accurate evaluation in a reasonable time when run inside a browser. Another possibility we have is to try to figure out an evaluation that is less accurate but can be computed in a very short amount of time and therefore will allow us to search deeper into the game to compensate. This was the approach used for this agent.

Firstly it checks if the game is over and if it is, returns a large positive or negative score (depending on the winner). If the game is not over it means we cannot see the end of the game within our search tree. so we must estimate how close we are to winning. To do this we check how many possible remaining ways there are for us to win a board. For example in a board where we have played one move in the centre, we have four ways we can win, two diagonals, a vertical, and a horizontal line. Now imagine that our opponent plays in one of the corners. The total ways we can win is now reduced by one. The score given to each mini-board is multiplied by a weighting based on where the board is (middle > corner > edges) and the number of winning lines that rely on that board. All scores are then summed to give the final evaluation.

The function then evaluates the large TTT board the same way that we evaluate the small boards and applies a weight to it, as it is preferable to win the large board over a mini-board.

## Optimisations

With these two components we can create an agent that is able to play considerably better than an untrained human. But it is still resource intensive and takes a long time to calculate the best move. So we can apply some optimisation to vastly improve calculation speeds.

### Alpha-Beta pruning

The first optimisation technique available to us is to implement alpha-beta-pruning into our minimax algorithm. The gist of this technique is to “prune” large branches out of the search tree by eliminating positions that cant effect the outcome of the game. It's pointless to waste time computing a position that your opponent will never let you reach due to it taking a better move earlier.

### Simulated annealing

Another optimisation technique is something called simulated annealing (AKA “random jump”). The idea is to emulate a “temperature” which gradually decreases as the game goes on. This idea works really well for UTTT because the game ends in a predictable number of moves. The temperature represents a gradually decreasing probability that the agent returns a random move and skips evaluating the position. Positions that are evaluated deeper into the tree / later in the game have a lower chance to be skipped. The idea being that moves made earlier on in the game are far less important that moves made close to the end of the game. This helps to bring the average move time down and surprisingly doesn't hurt performance that much. This is a common strategy in a situation where the agent has a limited time to make all of its moves such as for engines playing chess.

### Progressive deepening

The last optimisation technique is called progressive deepening. This allows the agent to search more deeply into lines of play that are likely to result in good positions. For example If a line of play involves capturing a mini-board it is likely to be good so we should evaluate it more deeply than the others. This agent only makes use of alpha-beta-pruning for optimisation. In the future I plan to implement progressive deepening as well. Until then though, enjoy playing against my agent and have fun getting crushed...
