## Rain

This was one of the first projects I ever undertook using JavaScript. It helped to develop my understanding of how the language feels and functions as a pure programming language. Using the P5.js library I was able to build creative and visual projects without having knowlege of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

## Maze

This project was the start of what would later become a fascination with visualising algorithms. This program creates a solvable maze by treating the grid as a graph and performing a Depth-First-Search. I like this project for its simplicity and it shows clearly how the algorithm works.
