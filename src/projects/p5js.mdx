## Rain

This was one of the first projects I ever undertook using JavaScript. It helped to develop my understanding of how the language feels and functions as a pure programming language. Using the P5.js library I was able to build creative and visual projects without having knowlege of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

## Maze

This project was the start of what would later become a fascination with visualising algorithms. This program creates a solvable maze by treating the grid as a graph and performing a Depth-First-Search. I like this project for its simplicity and it shows clearly how the algorithm works.

## Fawkes - Click me!

In this project I experimented with user interaction by listening for mouse events. It also involves the use physics engine programming. Constant acceleration due to gravity is implemented here and simple kinematics are used to calculate the initial velocity of the shell so that the maximum height achieved by the shell perfectly reaches the point where the mouse was clicked before exploding.

## Warp

My personal favourite P5.js project. This project works by adjusting object speed and size to emulate a z-axis and paralax.
